## Process
Day 1: Took a lot of time putting together a wirefram, setting up to repository, and thinking through the general logic to create some psuedo code. I figured today I would take as much time thinking through the problem before starting since I have not worked on a project this size before. Being clear about the functionality and breaking down the process is fun and I think is going to make the hard coding a lot easier.
