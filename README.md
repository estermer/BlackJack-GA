## Process
Day 1: Took a lot of time putting together a wirefram, setting up to repository, and thinking through the general logic to create some psuedo code. I figured today I would take as much time thinking through the problem before starting since I have not worked on a project this size before. Being clear about the functionality and breaking down the process is fun and I think is going to make the hard coding a lot easier.

Here is a picture of my initial wireframe:

Day 2: Spent most of today just working on the HTML and CSS, playing around with features and getting it to be close to what I want for layout. Had to change a couple things from the wireframe, and made the page responsive. I really enjoyed flex boxes in class and through it woulld be the best way in laying out my page, yet I struggled a lot with it. I pretty much coded it the long way using padding, margin, and so on, then reverted back to using flex box to compare if what I did worked. Once I figured out the flex box, I was able to clean up my CSS a little.

Then I took some time to create some images and logos for my site such as the face of the cards, the back of the cards, and my logo. If I finish early, my goal is to make it even more stylish.
